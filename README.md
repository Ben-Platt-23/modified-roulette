# modified-roulette

This python program is supposed to replicate a modified version of Roulette that I created with a partner in my applied statisics class during my senior year at St. Andrews Episcopal School. 

All the code was written by me

If you are playing the game please ignore the almost endless input questions to move on to the next stage, i did this so that it would minimize the possibility of the game breaking, I haven't done in depth testing on if it can break but from the code I am confident that its almost impossible to break the functions given I have so many checks that will just prompt the user with the question until they enter a valid response.
